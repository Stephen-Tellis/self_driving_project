# The Self Driving project
A weekend project I took up, trying to test path tracking control algorithms on a simulated car for fun.  
Readability is valued over efficiency.  
MPC and tests coming next week!  

## Examples

### 1. Driving with the Pure-Pursuit controller

### 2. Driving with the Stanley controller

## Deps
- Pygame == 1.9.6
- Numpy == 1.22.3  
(may work on other versions)
